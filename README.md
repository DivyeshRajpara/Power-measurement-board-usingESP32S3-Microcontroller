# Power-measurement-board-usingESP32S3-Microcontroller
This project involves the development of a power-measurement board designed using KiCad and programmed with the ESP32-S3 microcontroller. The board measures electrical power and transmits the data via BLE to a mobile device. The project includes KiCad design files, ESP32-S3 firmware, and a mobile app interface for real-time data monitoring.
